# ws-controller-midi
Midi controller interface for the WebSocket controller project


# Installation
This project uses the [node midi package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/midi) which has its own set of requirements to build and install.

After you have ensured that you meet the requirements for the node midi package, run `npm i` to install the projects packages, then use your process manager of choice (I recommend [PM2](https://www.npmjs.com/package/pm2)) to start client.js as a background process.
